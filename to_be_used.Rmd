EXERCISE 2 - NPAG WITH COVARIATES
---------------------------------------

Again, without copying files, let's create another run object, this time
using a model that include covariates

First clone mod1 mod2 \<- mod1\$clone()

Then update it
mod2$update(list( pri = list( V0 = ab(30, 120), V = NULL ), sec = "V = V0*(WT/55)" )) we can also make a model object by loading a file mod2b <- PM_model$new("../src/model2.txt")

exFit2 \<-
PM_fit$new(data = exData, model = mod2) You can build the PM_fit object with file sources directly, but this means that you have to copy files to the working directory, or specify paths relative to the working directory as below exFit2 <- PM_fit$new(data
= "../src/ex.csv", model = "../src/model2.txt")

exFit2$check() exFit2$run()

list.files() exRes2 \<- PM_load(2)

EXERCISE 3 - COMPARING MODELS
-------------------------------------------

Let's compare model 1 and model 2. You can compare any number of models.
Type ?PM_compare for help. PM_compare(exRes, exRes2)

EXERCISE 4 - MODEL VALIDATION
-------------------------------------------

MODEL VALIDATION EXAMPLES Example of Pmetrics visual predictive check
and prediction-corrected visual predictive check for model validation -
be sure to have executed the NPAG run above Type ?makeValid in the R
console for help. Choose wt as the covariate to bin. Accept all default
bin sizes. valid_2 \<- exRes2\$validate(limits = c(0, 3))

To see what it contains, use: valid_2

Default visual predictive check; ?plot.PM_valid for help valid_2\$plot()

or old S3 plot(valid_2)

or take advantage of the valid object being added automatically to the
result object exRes2$valid$plot()

or S3 plot(exRes2\$valid)

Generate a prediction-corrected visual predictive check; type
?plot.PMvalid in the R console for help. valid_2\$plot(type = "pcvpc")

Create an npde plot valid_2\$plot(type = "npde")

Here is another way to generate a visual predicive check... npc_2 \<-
valid_2$simdata$plot(obs = exRes2\$op, log = F, binSize = 1)

The jagged appearance of the plot when binSize=0 is because different
subjects have different doses, covariates, and observation times, which
are all combined in one simulation. Collapsing simulation times within 1
hour bins (binSize=1) smooths the plot, but can change the P-values in
the numerical predictive check below.

npc_2 ...and here is a numerical predictive check P-values are binomial
test of proportion of observations less than the respective quantile

EXERCISE 5 - SIMULATOR RUN
----------------------------------------------

The following will simulate 100 sets of parameters/concentrations using
the first subject in the data file as a template. Limits are put on the
simulated parameter ranges to be the same as in the model. The
population parameter values from the NPAG run in exercise 2 (exRes2) are
used for the Monte Carlo Simulation. simdata \<- exRes2\$sim(include =
1, limits = NA, nsim = 100)

simulate from a model with new data sim_new \<- exRes2\$sim( data =
"../src/ptaex1.csv", include = 2, limits = NA, predInt = c(120, 144,
0.5) )

sim_new\$plot(log = F)

Plot it; ?plot.PMsim for help simdata\$plot()

Simulate using multiple subjects as templates simdata2 \<-
exRes2\$sim(include = 1:4, limits = NA, nsim = 100)

Plot the third simulation simdata2\$plot(at = 3)

or in S3 plot(simdata2\$data[[3]])

Parse and combine multiple files and plot them. Note that combining
simulations from templates with different simulated observation times
can lead to unpredictable plots simdata3 \<-
exRes2$sim(include = 1:4, limits = NA, nsim = 100, combine = T) simdata3$plot()

simulate with covariates in this case we use the covariate-parameter
correlations from run 2, which are found in the cov.2 object; we
re-define the mean weight to be 50 with SD of 20, and limits of 10 to 70
kg. We fix africa, gender and height covariates, but allow age (the last
covariate) to be simulated, using the mean, sd, and limits in the
original population, since we didn't specify them. See ?SIMrun for more
help on this and the Pmetrics manual.

covariate \<- list( cov = exRes2\$cov, mean = list(wt = 50), sd =
list(wt = 20), limits = list(wt = c(10, 70)), fix = c("africa",
"gender", "height") )

now simulate with this covariate list object simdata4 \<-
exRes2\$sim(include = 1:4, limits = NA, nsim = 100, covariate =
covariate)

compare difference in simulations without covariates simulated...
PM_simlist's plot function defaults to the first simulation
simdata2\$plot()

...and with covariates simulated simdata4\$plot()

Here are the simulated parameters and covariates for the first subject's
template; note that both wt and age are simulated, using proper
covariances with simulated PK parameters simdata4$data[[1]]$parValues

look in the working directory and find the "c_simdata.csv" and
"c_simmodel.txt" files which were made when you simulated with
covariates. Compare to original "simdata.csv" and "simmoddel.txt" files
to note that simulated covariates become Primary block variables, and
are removed from the template data file.

If you want to simulate from a manually specified model and external
parameter values, use something like this. sim_ext \<-
PM_sim\$run(poppar = list(wt = 1, mean = c() cov = matrix()), data =
PM_data, model = PM_model, ... ) see ?SIMrun for help, but poppar is a
list. The first object is a vector of weights for mixture model, or 1
for a single mode. The second object is a vector of mean parameter
values, or a matrix with each row the means for a given mode. The last
object is the covariance matrix, with diagonal elements the parameter
variances. As with any simulation, data and model objects are required.

EXERCISE 6 - SAVING PMETRICS OBJECTS
------------------------------------

The following objects have methods to save them to or load them from
files: PM_fit PM_result PM_sim PM_pta

Example - save the PM_result (exRes2) to the "2" folder
exRes2$save("2/exres2.rds") rds is the recommended file extension list.files("2") copy_exRes2 <- PM_result$load("2/exres2.rds")
copy_exRes2

If you want to save multiple objects into one single file, R provides
the following functionality

save(exFit, exData, mod1, exRes, simdata, file = "2/test_drug.Rdata")
list.files("2") load("2/test_drug.Rdata")

or save.image("2/workspace.Rdata") This will save all variables in your
environment list.files("2") load("2/workspace.Rdata")

EXERCISE 7 - CONTINUING RUNS OR EXTERNAL VALIDATIONS
--------------------

Example of a run with a non-uniform density This is a good way to
continue a previous run, in this case it continues where run 1 left off
setwd(paste(wd, "/Runs", sep = ""))

note that we can supply a run number to model, data, and prior
arguments. The numbers do not have to be the same. This will copy the
appropriate files from the specified run to be used in the current run.
By specifying a prior, we are starting with the non-uniform density from
the end of the specified fun. exFit2\$run(prior = 2) exRes3 \<-
PM_load(3)

We could also generate Bayesian posterior parameter estimates for a new
population this way, and with 0 cycles: exFit3 \<-
PM_fit(data=PM_data("newPop.csv"), mod2) exFit3\$run(prior = 2, cycles =
0) This won't run because we don't have a newPop.csv file, but shows you
how it could be done.

EXERCISE 8 - EXAMPLE PARAMETRIC IT2B RUN
--------------------------------

IT2B is our parametric population parameter estimator. Population
parameter value distributions are estimated as means and covariances.

EXAMPLE IT2B run - tlag, ka, kel, vol

Run IT2B. Type ?ITrun in the R console for help. Remember how we created
a PM_fit object way back in exercise 1? Now we can use it again, but
change the engine. exFit\$run(engine = "IT2B")

Type ?PM_load in the R console for help on PM_load. If you have done
extra runs, you may be at more than 4 by now. Check your working
directory to see the highest folder number, and replace the 4 below with
that number if necessary. run4 \<- PM_load(4)

Most of the commands above work the same for IT2B but some produce
different plots.

run4$final$plot() in the following plot, we standardize the x-scales to
enable comparisons of the widths of the normal distributions of the
parameter values run4$final$plot(standardize = "all")
run4$final$plot(standardize = c("Ke", "Ka", "Tlag"))

here's a bivariate plot of IT2B population parameter value distributions
run4$final$plot(Ke \~ V)

EXERCISE 9 - PROBABILITY OF TARGET ATTAINMENT
---------------------------

Note: these can be computationally intense and take some time.

Examples of probability of target attainment analysis Be sure to have
executed the NPAG run above and used PM_load(2) in EXERCISE 2 Type
?SIMrun, ?SIMparse, ?makePTA, or ?plot.PMpta into the R console for
help.

simulate with the template data file that contains different doses Look
at ?SIMrun for help on arguments to this function, including predInt,
seed, limits, nsim.

simlist1 \<- exRes2\$sim( limits = c(0, 3), data = "../src/ptaex1.csv",
predInt = c(120, 144, 0.5), seed = rep(-17, 4) )

now simulate with covariates; make sure that you defined the covariate
object first in Exercise 5 above and have loaded the results of Exercise
2 with PM_load(2) simlist2 \<- exRes2\$sim( limits = 5, data =
"../src/ptaex1.csv", predInt = c(120, 144, 0.5), seed = rep(-17, 4),
covariate = covariate )

make the first PMpta object to calculate the time above each target for
at least 60% of the dosing interval from 120 to 144 hours. Include
labels for the simulations. ?makePTA for help define simulation labels
first simlabels \<- c("600 mg daily", "1200 mg daily", "300 mg bid",
"600 mg bid")

pta1_2 \<- PM_pta\$new( simdata = simlist1, targets = c(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2,
4, 8, 16, 32), target.type = "time", success = 0.6, start = 120, end =
144 )

pta1b_2 \<- PM_pta\$new( simdata = simlist2, simlabels = simlabels,
targets = c(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), target.type = "time",
success = 0.6, start = 120, end = 144 )

summarize the results pta1_2$summary() pta1_2$summary(ci = 0.8)

in the summary()\$pta, simnum is the simulation (dose) number; target is
the MIC; prop.success is the proportion of the simulated profiles for
each dose/MIC that are above the success threshold (0.6); pdi.mean and
pdi.sd are the mean and standard deviation of the pharmacodynamic index
(PDI), in this case proportion of the interval \> MIC. In the \$pdi,
target and simnum are the same, but now the median and confidence
intervals (default 95%) PDI are shown. ?summary.PMpta for help

Plot the first without covariates. We didn't include simulation labels
in the makePTA command, so generics are used here, but we move it to the
bottom left; ?legend for help on arguments to supply to the legend list
argument to plot.PMpta.
pta1_2$plot(ylab = "Proportion with %T>MIC of at least 60%", grid = T, legend = list(x = "bottomleft")) pta1b_2$summary()

Plot the second with covariates simulated. Note the regimen labels are
included, but we move the legend to the bottom left. pta1b_2\$plot( ylab
= "Proportion with %T\>MIC of at least 60%", grid = T, legend = list(x =
"bottomleft") )

Now we'll define success as free auc:mic \> 100 with a free drug
fraction of 50% pta2_2 \<-
PM_pta$new( simdata = simlist2, simlabels = simlabels, targets = c(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), free.fraction = 0.7, target.type = "auc", success = 100, start = 120, end = 144 ) summary(pta2_2) pta2_2$plot(
ylab = "Proportion with AUC/MIC of at least 100", grid = T, legend =
list(x = "bottomleft") )

success is Cmax/MIC \>=10 pta3_2 \<-
PM_pta$new( simdata = simlist2, simlabels = simlabels, targets = c(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), target.type = "peak", success = 10, start = 120, end = 144 ) pta3_2$summary()
pta3_2\$plot(ylab = "Proportion with peak/MIC of at least 10", grid = T)

success = Cmin:MIC \> 1 pta4_2 \<-
PM_pta$new( simdata = simlist2, simlabels = simlabels, targets = c(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), target.type = "min", success = 1, start = 120, end = 144 ) pta4_2$summary()
pta4_2\$plot(ylab = "Proportion with Cmin/MIC of at least 1", grid = T,
legend = list(x = "bottomleft"))

now plot the PDI (pharmacodynamic index) of each regimen, rather than
the proportion of successful profiles. A PDI plot is always available
for PMpta objects. pta4_2\$plot(type = "pdi", ylab = "Cmin:MIC", grid =
T)

Each regimen has the 90% confidence interval PDI around the median
curve, in the corresponding, semi-transparent color. Make the CI much
narrower... pta4_2\$plot(type = "pdi", ci = 0.1)

...or gone altogether, put back the grid, redefine the colors, and make
lines narrower pta4_2\$plot( type = "pdi", ci = 0, grid = T, line =
list( color = c("blue", "purple", "black", "brown"), width = 1 ) )

now let's repeat the analysis but simulate the distribution of MICs
using susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to vancomycin contained in
the mic1 dataset within Pmetrics (?mic1)

see the source with ?mic1 pta4b_2 \<-
PM_pta$new( simdata = simlist2, simlabels = c("600 mg daily", "1200 mg daily", "300 mg bid", "600 mg bid"), targets = makePTAtarget(mic1), target.type = "min", success = 1, start = 120, end = 144 ) plot it pta4b_2$plot(
grid = T, ylab = "Proportion with Cmin/MIC of at least 1", marker =
list(color = "red"), line = list(color = "black") ) pta4b_2\$plot(type =
"pdi", grid = T, ylab = "Proportion with Cmin/MIC of at least 1")

note that the plot changes since target MICs are no longer discrete
since most of the MICs are very low, the regimens all look very similar

success = concentration at time 3 hours:MIC \> 2 pta5_2 \<-
PM_pta$new( simdata = simlist2, simlabels = simlabels, targets = c(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), target.type = 123, success = 2, start = 120, end = 144 ) pta5_2$summary()
pta5_2\$plot(ylab = "Proportion with C3/MIC of at least 1", grid = T,
legend = list(x = .3, y = 0.1))

success is trough \>10 pta6_2 \<-
PM_pta$new( simdata = simlist2, simlabels = simlabels, targets = 10, target.type = 144, success = 1, start = 120, end = 144 ) plot(pta6_2) pta6_2$summary()

EXERCISE 10 - OPTIMAL SAMPLE TIMES
--------------------------------------

calculate MM-optimal sample times for Run 2, and the 1200 mg once daily
dose in the PTA By specifying the predInt to start and stop at 120 and
144 hours, with an interval of 1 hour, we are sampling at steady state.
Including "subject 2", means only the 1200 mg once daily dose will serve
as a simulation template.

mmopt_2 \<- exRes2\$MM_opt( data = "../src/ptaex1.csv", nsamp = 2,
predInt = c(120, 140, 1), include = 2 ) see the optimal sample times and
the Bayes Risk of misclassification, which is only useful to compare
optimal sampling regimens, i.e. the absolute value is less helpful, but
is the statistic minimized by the selected optimal sample times for a
given model

mmopt_2

plot it, with the red lines indicating the optimal sample times. see
?plot.MMopt for help

plot(mmopt_2) plot(mmopt_2, line = list(color = "slategrey"), times =
list(color = "orange"))

EXERCISE 11 - ASSAY ERROR
----------------------------------------------- see ?makeErrorPoly for
more help This will let you choose the best set of C0, C1, C2, C3 for
your modeling, based on assay validation data which includes the "obs",
which are the nominal concentrations of the standards, and "sd", which
is the standard deviation of replicate measurements of each of the
standards, i.e. the inter-day and/or intra-day standard deviation

obs \<- c(0, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000) sd \<- c(0.5, 6.4,
8.6, 12, 8.6, 37.2, 60.1, 165.7, 483)

See plots.pdf, page 50 makeErrorPoly(obs = obs, sd = sd)

choose the one with the best R-squared that will never result in a
negative value for the SD
